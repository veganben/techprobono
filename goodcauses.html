                <h2>Good causes</h2>
               <p>We invite you, the Good Causes, to outline your plans and motivations here, and to make a case for need. Perhaps you already have a static website and you would like a simple form to allow your guests to get in touch with you more easily.
                <p>Maybe you are a small family-run charity with your base firmly in the spare room and you feel that you need a more up-to-date look and feel - perhaps there is a designer out there who likes your cause and would be willing to make you a professionally designed logo.</p>
                <p>TechProBono attempts to match geeks with charities, clubs, the next generation of sporting heros, animal shelters, hospitals, schools, good causes and individuals with a technical need, but no finance.
